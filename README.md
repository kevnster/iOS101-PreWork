### My App Idea

My app idea, aims to assist elderly individuals, particularly immigrants who may not read English, in understanding their prescription medications independently. I was inspired by wanting to help my own mother manage her medications safely while I'm away at college. The app would use the phone's camera and computer vision (OCR) to scan the text on a prescription bottle label, identify the medication's name, and look up its purpose using reliable online drug information sources. Key features would include: 

1) **Scanning and Recognition:** Accurately reading the medication name from the label via the camera. 
2) **Information Lookup & Translation:** Finding the medication's purpose and translating both the name and description into a user-selected language (e.g., Spanish, Vietnamese, etc.). 
3) **Accessibility Features:** Presenting the translated information clearly with options for **large text** and a **read-aloud (text-to-speech)** function in the chosen language.

## Notes

My main challenge was getting familiar with the Xcode layout, as I sometimes struggled to find specific panels or options like the simulator list. Understanding the interface and actions like Control+Drag were important steps for me in this prework.
